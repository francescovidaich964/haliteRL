# Reinforcement learning to solve the Halite challenge

Halite is a programming game played by two or four players, which compete for the resources of the map. To win the game one must have more resources than his opponents at the end of the game. The game ends after a certain number of turns, that can vary from match to match, but usually is about 400 or 500 turns.

Achievements: 

- implemented the halite environment engine in python, compatible with the openAI gym standard;
- partially solved the resource collection task for a single ship and a single player with tabular methods; 
- implemented the multi-agent framework for tabular methods.
